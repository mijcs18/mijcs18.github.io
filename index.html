      <h2>Summary: Latitude vs. X</h2>
      <p> The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather 
          changes as you get closer to the equator. To accomplish this analysis,
          we first pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API to assemple a dataset
          on over 500 cities.
    
    
          After assembling the dataset, we used Matplotlib to plot various aspects of 
          the weather vs. latitude. Factors we looked at included: temprature, cloudiness, wind speed,
          and humpdity. This side provides the source data and visualiztions created as part 
          of the analysis, as well as explanations and descriptions of any trends and correlations witnessed.
